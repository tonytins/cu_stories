Though the castle was highly secure, especially since demolishing the isolationist policy, there were still blindspots and underground passages that I had found during my childhood. It seemed like they were designed incase of an emergency but also made a perfect escape route out of this boring and rigid life.

Needless to say, they looked worn down and didn’t inspire confidence when it came to it’s rigids. If anything were to happen down here, I had only my handbag to protect me and that had my phone. As I slowly ventured through the tunnels, I saw the exit. Freedom!

As I walked up to the station, I pulled up my digital ticket from my phone. When the train finally arrived, I showed my ticket and the conductor told me which room I’d be in. But as I was one of the only furries at the station tonight, the conductor wasn’t afraid to speak up.

“Oliver?” They asked.

I stopped in my footsteps as the doors began to gradually close behind us. “Y-yes?” I hesitantly replied while turning my head slightly towards them.

“Oliver!” The conductor raised her voice in shock from the sudden realization. “What are you doing onboard the Sunset Express? Again!”

“Again?” I paused and turned towards them as the train began to move. “How would you know I’ve done it again? This is the first time we’ve met.”

“You’re the prince, dingas!” The conductor replied, shaking their head. “Of course the whole railroad is going to know about your gallivanting throughout the kingdom at night.”

“So why speak up now?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.

They pointed to the ticket’s destination. Furtropolis. I shrugged and wondered what the big deal was. The conductor argued that the place is still going through some growing pains. Again, I brushed it off. But they warned me that it wasn’t like previous places, which were built during the isolationist era, and thus a lot more kinder to the prince.

“Fine!” I replied with a slightly raised voice, expressing annoyance. “I’ll buy an extra pair of underwear when I get to Grand Central. Now can you show me to my room?” The conductor sighed and guided me to my room.

As an overnight express train, it didn’t make any stops compared to others along the line and got into Furtropolis early the next morning. As I stepped off the train with my handbag and my way up to the concourse, I began to marvel at the craftsmanship of the station. The sun’s light beamed through the glass ceiling providing a nice sense of openness in an otherwise closed environment.

I remembered what the conductor had said yesterday and looked down at my outfit. It was a dark blue tunic with short sleeves and gold stripes along the shoulders, waist and cuffs. I didn’t take any of my badges or medals with me. Just the silver necklace with the Catsinbrug crown hanging from it that my dad gave me. At the very least they would see me as a cosplayer. But maybe I should see what the locals here wear.
