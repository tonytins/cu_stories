# Casey Universe Stories

Casey Universe Stories, or CU Stories, is a anthology series written by Tony Bark and taking place in the titled [fictional universe](https://cu.tonybark.com/).

Some stories may also come around my own personal [game jam](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_jam) time that I setup that'll focus on writing, instead of games. These I've scheduled to begin every third Monday and end Wednesday morning, though these are simply guidelines.
